Write a function that takes in an array of strings and returns a list of groups of anagrams. Anagrams are strings made up of exactly the same letters, where order doesn't matter. For example, "cinema" and "iceman" are anagrams; similarly, "foo" and "ofo" are anagrams. Note that the groups of anagrams don't need to be ordered in any particular way.
